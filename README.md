# MNIST classifier using tensorflow

My introductory demo for making an mnist classifier with Tensorflow.

This is work in progress, and designed for a presentation along side the notebook.

Basic_MNIST-1 is the introductory, documented notebook.

Basic_MNIST-tb1 is undocumented, but the exact same model as Basic_MNIST-1 but runs Tensorboard.
