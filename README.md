# MNIST classifier using tensorflow

My introductory demo for making an mnist classifier with Tensorflow.

This is work in progress, and designed for a presentation along side the notebooks.

Basic_MNIST - Heavily documented, introductory notebook using low-level tensorflow (1 fc layer)

Conv_MNIST - Documented notebook using low-level tensorflow (2 conv, 2 fc layers)

tb_models/ - The same two models, but running tensorboard

keras_models/ - Lightly documented notebooks with the same two models but running keras

pytorch_models/ - Lightly documented notebooks with the same two models but running pytorch
